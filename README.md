Hello!
# Here, I'm Agnay Krishna, and I Created a webpage on the Porsche 911 GT3 RS. 
It is evident from this website that there are sufficient photographs posted for the visual display. 
I've added a list function to display the car's specifications, followed by photos that, when clicked, will take us to a website with information about the car's parts. Next, there's a picture of the car's generations, and we've used image mapping so that,
if we click on any of them, information about that generation will be displayed, followed by a table with information about the car, including its price. 
Additionally, we have a hover function that allows the table to hover when we scroll through it, as well as an i frame that allows us to view the car's video on the website.
